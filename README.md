Hi! I'm an aspiring data scientist, and this is my first project where I am applying hands-on practice using Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, and Seaborn. 
The goal of this project is to explore and analyze a dataset to uncover valuable insights.
Project Overview
In this project, I work with various data analysis techniques, focusing on data visualization and exploration. I have utilized the following libraries and tools:

Pandas for data manipulation and cleaning.
NumPy for numerical operations and array handling.
Seaborn for visualizations and statistical graphics.
I have used different visualization techniques such as:

Histograms to understand the distribution of numerical data.
Bar Charts to compare categorical data.
Heatmaps to analyze correlations and relationships between variables.
Project Highlights
Data Cleaning: Handling missing values, transforming columns, and ensuring the dataset is ready for analysis.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Using various visualizations to extract insights and understand the patterns in the data.
Data Visualization: Creating impactful visualizations that provide deeper insights into the data, including histograms, bar charts, and heatmaps.
Libraries Used
Pandas
NumPy
Seaborn
Matplotlib (for advanced visualization)
